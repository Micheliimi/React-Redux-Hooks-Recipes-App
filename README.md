# Welcome to the Trivia Game Project!

---
This project is a trivia game based on Trivia, developed using React and Redux.

# Features:

  - Log into the game and, if the email is registered on the Gravatar website, have your photo associated with    the user's profile.

  - Access the page related to the game, where you must choose one of the answers available for each of the questions presented. The answer must be marked before the timer reaches zero, otherwise the answer will be considered wrong.

  - Be redirected, after 5 questions answered, to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of hits.

  - View the ranking page, if you like, at the end of each game.

  - Configure some options for the game in a configuration screen accessible from the app header.

### Trivia API 

The [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) is pretty simple. We have 2 endpoints that we will need to use for this exercise.

* **Get the session token from the person who is playing**
* **Get Q&A**
